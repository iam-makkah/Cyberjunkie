- Permission modification using chmod
- Ownership management using chown
- Principle of least privilege

## Activities Performed
- Analyzed file and directory permissions
- Modified permissions to restrict or allow access
- Changed file ownership and group assignments
- Applied basic security hardening practices

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux system security fundamentals
- Access control and permission management
- Security best practices
- Technical documentation
