## Project Overview
This project documents a hands-on security investigation using SQL queries to analyze
security-related data and identify potentially suspicious or malicious activity.

## Objective
To apply SQL querying techniques to investigate security events, detect anomalies,
and support threat identification in a simulated security scenario.

## Investigation Focus
- Analysis of security logs or event data
- Identification of unusual patterns or behaviors
- Detection of potential security threats

## Activities Performed
- Queried datasets using SQL to filter and analyze security events
- Investigated indicators such as repeated access attempts, unusual timestamps, and abnormal user behavior
- Documented findings and observations

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL for security investigations
- Log analysis and data filtering
- Analytical thinking
- Security incident investigation fundamentals
